CurtainMover.lmsp contains EV3 code for Lego Mindstorms EV3 Brick.

CurtainMover.py contains preliminary code for IoT version for use with Amazon Echo/Google Assistant.

The code for CurtainMover.py was sourced by https://www.hackster.io/amine-amri2/auto-curtains-f98c4b and https://www.hackster.io/darko-vranesa/lego-ev3-amazon-alexa-rpi3-3-gadgets-talk-to-each-other-86d09e

## Issues

Couldn't manage to get Python to work on the EV3 Brick and had no resource for an Amazon Echo Device.
